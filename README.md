 ### **Overview**
- In real world, farmers face lots of devastating loss only due to they don't know which disease is affecting their crop. This project is mainly focused to solve that problem.
- Here I take images of corn, potato and tomato which is affected by the disease **Corn-Common_rust, Potato-Early_blight and Tomato-Bacterial_spot** and train it on custom **CNN** model.

### :raising_hand: Project Workflow 

Our pipeline consists of three steps:
  1. An AI model which detect plant disease.
  2. An AI model which predict if the leaves has disease or not.
  3. The output predicted disease name.
  
### ðŸš€ Model's performance
  - **Our Custom CNN model** perform better by giving near 95% accuracy.
